# better vectors
An assortment of vector illustrations with included alternate descriptions. 
## What are these for?
I kept seeing ubiquitous graphics on the web that all looked the same and honestly had that old guy moment of, “I could do that!”. But I decided to take it a step further by including alternate descriptions so people could just use these in their projects as they needed without having to go through the dog and pony show of figuring out how to describe them.
I purposely made the Gestures on here look the same as just about any other illustration I’ve come across. I wanted things to seem as consistent as possible on the web. And I didn’t want anyone to have to pay for something that took me about 4 minutes to make.  
## Can I use them?
Feel free to use them as long as you incorporate alternate descriptions for them as appropriate. The full text of NOTICE.txt is copied below, made prettier for those of us who understand content that’s organized a bit better.
Each illustration is within a folder describing their use. Over time, I (or any contributor who decides to give me a hand with this little side project), will be updating more illustrations. I draw a lot, so I’ll just add to this repo as much as I can. 
Each folder contains both an Adobe Illustrator (AI) folder, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) folder. Feel free to use the file type you need, change the file type to something else, and manipulate them as you like. The only requirement is to adhere to the NOTICE.txt file as per the License.
## How can I help?
(It’s really weird writing in the first person when I’m talking about you rather than  me.)
You can help contribute by:
- Offering some illustrations and don’t mind giving them a way for free, because that would be great;
- Teaching me how to make SVGs correctly instead of making them with Illustrator;
- Show me how to make the SVGs more accessible and usable, because that would be amazeballs;
- Making the SVGs on here less terrible by stripping out the proprietary crap that gets embedded in there because I used Illustrator, and I’m sure the internets will probably love you for it.
- Suggest more illustrations that I can make! Please feel free to request them;
- Suggest better alternate descriptions;
- Tell others about this project!
## NOTICE
By using these files, you agree to abide by the terms within this NOTICE.txt file as mandated by the [License][1].
### REQUIREMENTS FOR USE
The purpose of these files is to provide quality illustrations for use in content where it can be difficult finding quality illustrations in the first place. Further, they are intended to be accessed by a wide range of individuals, regardless of diverse needs. To meet this criteria, you agree to adhere to both [‘A’- and 'AA'-level Success Criteria][2], detailed within the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1][3], when using these illustrations. 
As these are original files, they may be used in any capacity in either their original or modified form. The concept of modifying them is extended to how they are used, including scripting, animating, manipulating, and many other applications. **No matter how they are manipulated to fit your needs, it is important to remember that the License prohibits their usage without considering the accessibility requirements of *how they are used*.**
[The Success Criteria for WCAG 2.1][4] is only required based on the usage of the illustrations. However applicable it may be for your usage of these illustrations, **you agree to meet the updated WCAG 2.1 success criteria**, as it relates to ***your usage*** of these illustrations. 
### Additional Requirements
1. Where applicable, the following additional success criteria are required for use of these illustrations as long as meeting them does not significantly impede the purpose of their usage:
	- [1.3.6 Identify Purpose — (AAA)][5]
	- [1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) — (AAA)][6]
	- [2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)][7]
2. Using these illustrations means you agree to link to this project somewhere on your site that is programmatically accessible. You can meet these criteria by including it in screen reader only text, placing it somewhere in the source code, or simply attaching metadata to the file. (If the metadata becomes stripped from the images in use, none of these requirements will be considered to be met).
	**You do not need to ruin your designs by cluttering the site with a bunch of citation crap. Feel free to obfuscate it, as long as it’s somewhere that is reasonably noticeable without much effort.**
