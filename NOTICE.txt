NOTICE.txt

By using these files, you agree to abide by the terms within this NOTICE.txt file as mandated by the License.

REQUIREMENTS FOR USE

The purpose of these files is to provide quality illustrations for use in content where it can be difficult finding quality illustrations in the first place. Further, they are intended to be accessed by a wide range of individuals, regardless of diverse needs. To meet this criteria, I ask that you adhere to both 'A'- and 'AA'-level Success Criteria detailed within the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) when using these illustrations. 

As these are the original files, it is possible for them to be used in any capacity, which includes scripting them, animating them, using them in slide shows, and many other applications. No matter how they are manipulated to fit your needs, it is important to remember that the License prohibits their usage without considering the accessibility requirements of how they are used.

If their use is NOT related to the criteria (including but not limited to animation, scripting, hyperlinking, used as decorations, etc.), then only the criteria that meets its usage is required. 

However applicable it may be for your usage of these illustrations, you agree to meet both WCAG 2.0 as well as the updated WCAG 2.1 success criteria, as they relate to the use of non-text content. 

Further, the following additional success criteria are required for use of these illustrations, where applicable, and as long as meeting such criteria would not significantly affect their usage in meeting the 'A'- and 'AA'-level Success Criteria:

1.3.6 Identify Purpose — (AAA)
1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) — (AAA)
2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA)
