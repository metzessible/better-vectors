#About these gestures

This is a collection of gestures that relate to tapping.
Both folders contain the same files with the same filenames, and they've been created with an included XMP file.

##AI Folder

Inside the AI folder is a collection of Adobe Illustrator files.

## SVG Folder

Insider the SVG folder are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) created by Illustrator. 
I don't really know SVG that well, so I'm not sure what bloat to get rid of and 
what bloat to keep. Sorry about that.
